/*
 * Represents a composite proposition of type event, that holds if all the propositions
 * are false at some state. Then, all of the propositions become true at some future 
 * state. Such that, each proposition holds in a specified order with one proposition 
 * holding per state, at a successive rate. State 's' is the state in which the last 
 * consecutive proposition holds.    
 * 
 * Given a composite proposition, it can generate itself as a ConsecutiveE formula with
 * the composite proposition variable names in the formula.
